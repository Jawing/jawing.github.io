<!-- ## About me -->

Optimistic learner in harmony with space and time.  
Striving for openness, connection and balance.  

I'm a graduate researcher at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) specializing in [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning). My current academic interests focuses on the application of Continual [Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_reinforcement_learning) in fields such as robotics, education, and healthcare.

During my free time, I enjoy mentoring [ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/), figure skating [‚õ∏Ô∏è](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbelrZHSCjU), dancing [üíÉüï∫](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Zouk), playing the piano [üéπ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgoP2m5pZfQ) and learning new languages [üåé](https://mundolingo.org/).

\- Creatively experimented with reward functions, network structure and hyperparameters that led to insights for optimizing the agents' total return. Identified potential limitations and proposed future research directions including Self-Supervised RL and Offline-RL.

**Machine Learning Researcher Intern \| Humanware, Longueuil, QC** \| 2022-2023 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Humanware_Internship_Report.pdf)  
\- Led the development and fine-tuning of object detection models, leveraging SOTA models such as RegionCLIP to enhance detection robustness, outperforming classical object detectors in out-of-distribution scenarios.  
\- Implemented an Android demo application with voice guidance for the visually impaired. Proposed novel multimodal models with active data collection for continual learning and adapting to changing data distributions supporting  long-term model robustness.

**Convolution vs Attention \| University of Montreal** \| 2022 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Conv_vs_Attention.pdf)  
\- Comparatively analyzed deep vision models (ResNet, ViT, ConvNext) based on convolution or attention architectures using a proxy shape-bias metric on out-of-domain stylized samples (generated by a GAN network) to evaluate classification generalization performance; visualizations are shown [here](./assets/images/shape-bias.html).

**Hockey Goal Prediction \| University of Montreal** \| 2021 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](./_posts/2021-11-30-milestone-2.md)  
\- Performed exploratory data analysis on NHL play-by-play data by building an interactive 2D shot-heatmap using Plotly and ipywidgets.  
\- Developed a goal prediction service on Flask with Docker using an ensemble deep learning model based on their ROC-AUC in comet.ml.

<!-- **Navigaze \| McGill Code Jam** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](https://devpost.com/software/navigreat-hviz0n)  
\- Designed a browser extension that generates a table-of-contents from any webpage, text selection using keywords, key sentences for text summarization.  
\- Developed the backend extractive text summarization model using TextRank algorithm with spaCy and Flask. -->

**Orderly \| Grace Dart Extended Care Centre (CIUSSS ODIM), Montreal, QC** \| 2020-2021 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](https://www.ciusss-ouestmtl.gouv.qc.ca/installations/chsld/centre-de-soins-prolonges-grace-dart/)  
\- Provided compassionate care to residents while working in teams managing their personal hygiene and daily routines, while following all safety protocols.  
\- Improved the mental well-being of residents by engaging in friendly social interactions; organizing groups and partner activities (exercises, social games, puzzles) while actively listening to their needs and inquiries.

**Toxicity Detection \| McGill** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Toxicity_Detection.pdf)  
\- Compared performances across different models such as CNN, LSTM, Transformers and lexical using ROC-AUC metrics for detecting toxicity while maximizing group fairness across different identity subgroups.  
\- Finetuned transformer models such as BERT, and GPT using word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe.

<!-- **SqueezeNet Reproducibility \| McGill** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Squeezenet_Reproducibility.pdf)  
\- Analysis of SqueezeNet architecture vs AlexNet on CIFAR-10 by ablation while maintaining the model size reduction intended in SqueezeNet.

**Modified MNist Classification \| McGill** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Modified_Mnist_Classifier.pdf)  
\- Incrementally tested hyperparameters such as loss functions, optimizers, normalization, dropouts, preprocessing and augmentations (OpenCV) for image classification.  
\- Worked with state-of-the-art CNN models (Resnet, EfficientNet) and developed ensembles to further increase classification accuracies. -->

**Irrelevant.ai \| McGill ImplementAI** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](https://devpost.com/software/irrelevant-ai)

<!-- ## About me -->

An optimistic learner, in harmony with space and time. Striving for openness, connection and balance in all perspectives. Actively engaged in thought-provoking concepts in life and philosophy.

I'm a recent graduate researcher at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) specializing in [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning). My current academic interests focuses on the application of Continual [Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_reinforcement_learning) in fields such as robotics, education, and healthcare. During my free time, I enjoy mentoring, figure skating, dancing, playing the piano and learning new languages.

## Experiences

**Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Space-invader \| McGill University** \| Spring 2023 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/RL_Project_paper.pdf)  
\- Directed a group project focused on the comparative analysis of various reinforcement learning algorithms including Deep Q-Network, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a multi-agent setting, using the Atari Space-Invader environment in PettingZoo; presentation shown [here](https://youtu.be/U5Z_gL2xs4w).  
\- Conducted creative experimentation with extrinsic vs intrinsic reward functions, network hyperparameters and structure that led to the improvement of the agents' total reward. Identified potential limitations and proposed future research directions including self-supervised contrastive learning and offline-RL.

**Machine Learning Researcher Intern \| Humanware, Longueuil, QC** \| 2022-2023 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Humanware_Internship_Report.pdf)  
\- Led the development and fine-tuning of object detection models, leveraging SOTA models such as RegionCLIP to enhance detection robustness, outperforming classical object detectors in out-of-distribution scenarios.  
\- Implemented an Android demo application with voice guidance for the visually impaired, while also proposing recommendations for novel multimodal models for continual learning and active data collection that can adapt to changing data distributions to support long-term model robustness.

**Convolution vs Attention \| University of Montreal** \| 2022 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Conv_vs_Attention.pdf)  
\- Comparatively analyzed deep vision models (ResNet, ViT, ConvNext) based on convolution or attention architectures using a proxy shape-bias metric on out-of-domain stylized samples (generated by a GAN network) to evaluate classification generalization performance; visualizations are shown [here](./assets/images/shape-bias.html).

**Hockey Goal Prediction \| University of Montreal** \| 2021 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](./_posts/2021-11-30-milestone-2.md)  
\- Performed exploratory data analysis on NHL play-by-play data by building an interactive 2D shot-heatmap using plotly and ipywidget.  
\- Developed a goal prediction service on Flask with Docker using an ensemble deep learning model based on their ROC-AUC in comet.ml.

<!-- **Navigaze \| McGill Code Jam** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](https://devpost.com/software/navigreat-hviz0n)  
\- Designed a browser extension that generates a table-of-contents from any webpage, text selection using keywords, key sentences for text summarization.  
\- Developed the backend extractive text summarization model using TextRank algorithm with spaCy and Flask. -->

**Orderly \| Grace Dart Extended Care Centre (CIUSSS ODIM), Montreal, QC** \| 2020-2021 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](https://www.ciusss-ouestmtl.gouv.qc.ca/installations/chsld/centre-de-soins-prolonges-grace-dart/)  
\- Provided compassionate care to residents while working in teams managing their personal hygiene and daily routines, while following all safety protocols.  
\- Improved the mental well-being of residents by engaging in friendly social interactions, and organizing group one-on-one activities (card games, trivia, bingo, walks) while actively listening to their needs and inquiries.

**Toxicity Detection \| McGill** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Toxicity_Detection.pdf)  
\- Compared performances across different models such as CNN, LSTM, Transformers and lexical using ROC-AUC metrics for detecting toxicity while maximizing group fairness across different identity subgroups.  
\- Finetuned transformer models such as BERT, and GPT using word embeddings such as word2vec and GloVe.

<!-- **SqueezeNet Reproducibility \| McGill** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Squeezenet_Reproducibility.pdf)  
\- Analysis of SqueezeNet architecture vs AlexNet on CIFAR-10 by ablation while maintaining the model size reduction intended in SqueezeNet.

**Modified MNist Classification \| McGill** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Modified_Mnist_Classifier.pdf)  
\- Incrementally tested hyperparameters such as loss functions, optimizers, normalization, dropouts, preprocessing and augmentations (OpenCV) for image classification.  
\- Worked with state-of-the-art CNN models (Resnet, EfficientNet) and developed ensembles to further increase classification accuracies. -->

**Irrelevant.ai \| McGill ImplementAI** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](https://devpost.com/software/irrelevant-ai)  
\- Designed a movie recommendation system with a two-stage supervised learning model from Fast.ai using collaborative filtering and unsupervised K-means clustering with Scikit-learn.  
\- Developed a filtering algorithm that lets the user explore beyond the AI recommendation feedback loop while maintaining a positive user rating.

<!-- **Hotel Database Designer \| McGill** \| 2018  
\- Worked in teams to analyze and understand business and user requirements to create a detailed database design model of a hotel.  
\- Wrote complex queries and functions using SQL and Java languages for applications to interact with the database. -->
